    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Maggie Rickert. I was born and raised in Ann Arbor, Michigan, but I now live in Nashville, Tennessee. I am a student-athlete on the volleyball team here at Gonzaga. I am a sophmore, almost junior here and I am studying accounting. I have two older silbings, my sister, Sam, is 24 and my brother, Dan, is 23. My mom works in adversitsing sales and my dad is an automotive engineer. I also have the cutest little english bulldog named Bosa, she is definetly my parents favorite child. When I am not playing volleyball I enjoy working out, coloring, puzzles, board games, and reading. </p>

    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>I grew up in Nashville, Tennessee, and started playing volleyball around the age of 8. My older sister, Sam, played volleyball so I was constantly exposed to it.</p>
    <p>During high school, I played travel volleyball and that is how I got in touch with the Gonzaga volleyball coaches. They reached out to me and I came on a vist during my junior year of high school. It was my first time on the West Coast and I immediately fell in love with the city, the campus, and the people. I commited to Gonzaga shortly after my visit and started planning my move across the country.  </p>
    <p>Being a student-athlete at the college level requires an extreme amount of commitment. It requires a significant amount of dedication and time management. This expeirence, that I am blessed enough to be a part of, has helped shape who I am today. </p>
